<h3>this is Duke Anh's Before-University python notebooks</h3>

<p>I this is where i aggregate my Python self-learning journey, this miscellaneous bunch of .ipynd files might be chaotic but i haven't got any proper education or personal mentorship, all was studied by pure interests. I will be attending the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor as an Data Science major next year on 2025 so, until the August of 2025, this would still be here but not active as before.</p>

<p>i'm currently talking to myself right now but i hope in the future someone's gonna find this Git and kind of know where i left of and witnessed my growth</p>
